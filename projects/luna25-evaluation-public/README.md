# ðŸ“¦ LUNA25 Evaluation Code
Thank you for participating in the [LUNA25 Challenge](https://luna25.grand-challenge.org/).

In LUNA25, we want to use artificial intelligence for lung nodule malignancy risk estimation on low-dose chest CT scans.
Baseline algorithms for LUNA25 can be found at [LUNA25-Baseline](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/luna25-baseline) 

This repository contains the scripts that will be used for evaluation of the developed AI algorithms of participating teams.

For questions, refer to the [LUNA25 Challenge Page](https://luna25.grand-challenge.org/).

Good luck!
